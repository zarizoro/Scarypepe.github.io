Create links that scroll the page smoothly to any id within the document.

== Description ==

**Page scroll to id** is a fully featured plugin which replaces browser's "jumping" behavior with a [smooth scrolling animation](http://manos.malihu.gr/repository/page-scroll-to-id/demo/demo.html), when links with href value containing # are clicked. It provides all the basic tools and advanced functionality for single-page websites, in-page navigation, back-to-top links etc. with features like: 

* Adjustable scrolling animation [duration and easing (over 30 easing types)](http://manos.malihu.gr/page-scroll-to-id-for-wordpress/#plugin-settings-scroll-type-easing)
* Link and target highlighting via ready-to-use CSS classes
* [Vertical](http://manos.malihu.gr/repository/page-scroll-to-id/demo/demo.html) and/or [horizontal](http://manos.malihu.gr/repository/page-scroll-to-id/demo/demo-horizontal-layout.html) scrolling
* Scrolling from/to different pages (scrolling to target id on page load)
* Offset scrolling by pixels or element selector with custom expressions
* Insert link and target id buttons in post visual editor 
* Link-specific offset, scrolling duration, highlight target etc.

= Requirements =

Page scroll to id requires WordPress version **3.3** or higher (jQuery version **1.7.0** or higher) and your theme **must** (and should) have `wp_head()` and `wp_footer()` functions. In some Microsoft Windows based web servers some plugins might produce an error 500 (depends on server/PHP configuration). To pinpoint the issue [enable debugging](https://codex.wordpress.org/Debugging_in_WordPress) in `wp-config.php` and check `wp-content/debug.log` file for relevant errors.

= GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) =

The plugin is GDPR compliant. It does not use or store any kind of user information/data. In fact, it's functionality has nothing to do with user data (personal or otherwise). So there's that.

= Quick usage and tips =

1. [Install the plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/page-scroll-to-id/installation/). 
2. The plugin is enabled by default on your WordPress Menu links, so you can start adding custom links and set their URL to the id/target you want to scroll to. 
3. Create id targets within your content using plugin's "Insert Page scroll to id target" button and/or shortcode (see contextual "Help" menu in plugin settings page) in post visual/text editor. Create targets in widgets areas using "Page scroll to id target" widget. 
5. Create links within your content using plugin's "Insert/edit Page scroll to id link" button and/or shortcode in post visual/text editor. You can also add the class `ps2id` on any existing link you want to be handled by the plugin. 

For more info [see plugin's basic tutorial](http://manos.malihu.gr/page-scroll-to-id-for-wordpress-tutorial/)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Please visit plugin's [Knowledge Base - FAQ](http://manos.malihu.gr/page-scroll-to-id-for-wordpress/2/) for up-to-date info and guides. 

= Is it GDPR compliant? =

Yes.

= Why it hasn't been updated for x weeks/months? =

Because it works and it already has a ton of features. The plugin has little dependency on WordPress functions so it doesn't need to be updated every time WordPress updates (that's why it works on ancient WordPress versions like 3.3).
